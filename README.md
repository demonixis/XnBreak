# XnBreak

XnBreak is a Breakout game, it's also my very first game made with XNA.
Because it's one of my first games, it's bugged, the code is not very optimized and there are some comments in French.

This is the XNA version adapted to work with MonoGame. Sources can contains references to Windows Phone 7, 8 and Windows Metro.
